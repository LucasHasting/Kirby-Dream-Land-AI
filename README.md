2. Install gym-retro
3. Install gym version 0.25
4. Move the KirbysDreamLand-GameBoy folder into the \Programs\Python\Python38\Lib\site-packages\retro\data\stable directory which may require some research on where that folder is based on the operating system. 

More steps TBA

The data is gathered using the integartion software which can be downloaded here, and must be moved to the \Programs\Python\Python38\Lib\site-packages\retro directory. 

The inegration software requires a rom with a supported file type, see here for more details. The integration software is a GUI that allows you to play the game, save game states, save memory addresses in variables, and has many more features which is used to gather data which will be used by the program.
